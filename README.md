### The new React19 use() hook

- This new hook that will be available on React 19 replaces both the need for `useContext` and for fetching inside `useEffect`.
- It can be called inside for loops and if statements
- But it still can only be called on client side

You can see how I used it [here](https://github.com/rsmelonw/SEO-Prod-Eng-Learning/blob/main/app/page.tsx#L20-L30), inside an if statement and with both context and fetching from api examples.
